            "Company-reported reason for change": "According to newly installed assembly lines in Nanjing plant in 2013, the GHG emissions rose due to the increased electricity consumptions. The trend on rising electricity consumption level has close connection to the increased GHG emissions per the unit. The ratio of sales to Acer during 2013 shows a small difference relative to the one in 2012, so we estimate that the change in this row may not take place for the revenue fluctuation.  On the other hand, in 2013, Ochang 1 plant in Korea begun to supply mobile batteries to Acer for the first time - Only Nanjing plant supplied batteries to Acer in 2012. Therefore, the energy efficiency difference between the two plants would affect the change.",

These containers are a rigid polypropylene container designed for multiple-uses: 1) they are display-ready and usable for chilled and humidified storage and display conditions; 2) they have an open side and base structure that can be quickly assembled for use and folded for storage/cleaning; and 3) the insides have rounded inner edges. IFCO RPCs are made in different standard sizes covering a range of fruit and vegetable produce applications. IFCO’s RPC types are mutually compatible (i.e., in terms of stacking properties) for segregated and mixed dispatch units and suited to the use of jawed loaders as well as materials handling technology and automatic storage systems. Definition of functional unit: products are compared on the basis of providing the same defined function or unit of service which is called the functional unit. The function of produce containers is to transport fresh produce from growers to retail locations. In the case of the RPCs and DRCs, the containers can also be used to display the produce at retail stores. The functional unit of this LCA is based on an equivalent quantity of produce delivered to stores: 1,000 tonnes of produce delivered to retail stores in North America (US or Canada).",

Compared to other technologies, SunPower converts the greatest percentage of sunlight into electricity. This means that over the lifetime of your system, you’ll generate more electricity and save more money on your electricity bills. •More energy from less space: SunPower E-Series solar panels convert more sunlight into electricity than conventional panels, delivering 36% more power per panel. •More electricity: SunPower E-Series residential solar panels convert more sunlight to electricity over the life of your system than conventional panels. Which means you produce 60% more energy over 25 years and save more on your electricity bills, too. •More flexibility: Because E-Series residential solar panels generate more electricity from a smaller area, you can expand energy production simply by using additional roof space to add more panels later. •More peace of mind: More guaranteed power. SunPower offers the best combined power and product warranty over 25 years. •The panels are designed to deliver consistent, trouble-free energy over a very long lifetime.",
